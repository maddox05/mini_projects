# Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
This project is a simple GUI application built using the Python tkinter library to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. It allows you to enter a temperature value, select the conversion type (Fahrenheit to Celsius or Celsius to Fahrenheit), and then calculate the converted value.

# How It Works
The application has a graphical user interface with the following components:

1. Entry Field: You can enter the temperature value you want to convert in this field.

2. Radio Buttons: There are two radio buttons to select the conversion type:
   Fahrenheit to Celsius: Converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
   Celsius to Fahrenheit: Converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

3. Calculate Button: When you click this button, the application will calculate and display the converted temperature based on your input and selected conversion type.

4. Result Label: This label displays the converted temperature or an error message if the input is not valid.
# Setting Up the Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from python.org.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Create a new directory for your project, if you haven't already, and navigate to it using the cd command.
4. Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended): python -m venv venv
5. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   On macOS and Linux:source venv/bin/activate

6. Save the provided code in a Python file, e.g., temperature_converter.py.
7. Install the required library tkinter. It is usually included with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.
8. Run the application: python temperature_converter.py

The GUI application will open, and you can use it to convert temperatures as described in the "How It Works" section.

# Usage
1. Enter the temperature value you want to convert in the "Enter Above" field.
2. Choose the conversion type by selecting one of the radio buttons:

To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, select "Fahrenheit to Celsius."
To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, select "Celsius to Fahrenheit."
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The converted temperature will be displayed in the label below the button.
